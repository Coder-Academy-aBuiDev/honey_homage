                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>Before the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia had minimal time to react after taking a tragic blow of uncontrollable bushfires. Such destruction was vast, consuming both wildlife and rural homes. Affecting many farmers and crops, the road to recovery for our honey farm was steep after losing countless bees.</p>
                    <h2>Our Battle</h2>
                    <p>We are ready now! Our loss of beehives has been replenished with great patience, and ready for open. Honey Homage is our next step moving forward. The foundation of our brand focuses on quality and customer satisfaction. As we follow through, we continue to care for our bees and hope to share their golden, sweetness with the rest of Australia.</p>
